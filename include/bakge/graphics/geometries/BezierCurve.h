/*! @brief A Bezier curve is rendered using control points.
 *
 * Bezier curves use control points to influence where the curve goes. Each
 * segment has an order equal to the number of control points it has. First
 * order segments follow parabolic curves while higher order segments can
 * be much more intricate. The BezierCurve starts out as one large curve
 * segment. Both endpoints are anchors and cannot be converted to control
 * points unless an extra point is appended or prepended as appropriate to
 * take its place. An endpoint can never be a control point, and as such
 * inserting a single point at either end of the line is always an
 * anchor
 *
 * Bezier curves currently will be used to build LineStrips from with
 * varying levels of accuracy. The more subdivisions used to generate
 * points along the curve, the more smooth and accurate the curve will
 * appear when rendered. This also requires more time to process and
 * create the array, which can take a noticeable length of time when dealing
 * with long curves with any of A) many segments, B) high-order segments,
 * C) high subdivision counts.
