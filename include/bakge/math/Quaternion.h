/* *
 * Quaternions are used to describe rotational orientations in 3D space.
 * They consist of four parts - Three which represent an axis, and the fourth
 * which represents a rotation about that axis (right-handed rule).
 * Quaternions are extremely useful because they avoid gimbal lock, a problem
 * that can arise from the use of Euler angles to store info.
 * Not only that, but quaternions are easy to turn into 4x4 matrices, split
 * into the individual parts (axis and angle) and can easily be created
 * from Euler angles.
 *
 * Quaternions also see use in animation keyframing, where joints' or bones'
 * rotations are relative to their parent joint.
