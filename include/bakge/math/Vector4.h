 * Vectors are used to represent arbitrary points, or directions (and
 * their magnitudes). The homogeneous fourth coordinate, identified as the w
 * coordinate, distinguishes points from 3D vectors. If w is 0, the Vector4
 * represents a vector with a direction and length, or magnitude. If w is a 1,
 * the Vector4 represents a point in 3D space. This is used to enforce common
 * logic -- a point plus a point is meaningless. A point plus a vector is
 * another point, and a vector plus a vector is another vector. Many operations
 * check this homogeneous coordinate before proceeding, such as scalar
 * multiplication. Dividing a point by a constant is meaningless. Dividing a
 * vector by a constant reduces its magnitude (length).
