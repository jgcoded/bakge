How to help
===========

The process of contributing code to Bakge may seem confusing and unnecessarily complex, but it's the best way to organize and keep track of various changes without accidentally breaking the master build or adding/removing files.

There are plenty of ways you can help without having to program:
- Run the test suite and report bugs to the issues page
- Tell your friends about Bakge!
- Look through the code and try to spot defects or bugs
- Contribute your ideas to the design of Bakge's components and classes

Building Bakge
==============

Bakge is built with CMake. I suggest you build into a single folder, build/. This way you can easily clean up CMake's generated files, and the .gitignore file will prevent you from accidentally adding generated files to your fork.

Bakge builds as a static library. Unit testing is done in the test/ directory. Bakge's repo is very friendly, with lots of guidelines and tips on how you can contribute. Feel free to message a contributor if you have any questions about getting started.

Note that Bakge doesn't include required external libraries in its source tree. See the lib/README file for info on downloading/installing these dependencies. Future renditions of the build system may included automated download and installation of required libraries, but for now you must do it by hand.


Commandline (Unix-like)
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
 $ make
